            <h5 class="finance-frog-h5">The Problem</h5>
            <p>Financial literacy is the ability to “understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing” (Investopedia). Financial literacy is a critical skill that everyone should cultivate, yet the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) states that 66% of Americans are lacking financial literacy, and this is quite alarming since financial illiteracy can lead to an accumulation of debt, poor spending decisions, poor credit, bankruptcy, and more. However, there is a current inequity when it comes to the people who receive education in the finance realm. One study reports a disparity in financial literacy across racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations tend to have lower rates of financial literacy, in addition to the young women, and people with less education. A lack of education, socioeconomic and political barriers contribute to the compounding of financial illiteracy across generations and further increases the gap.</p>

            <h5 class="finance-frog-h5">The Solution</h5>
            <p>Introducing Finance Frog: the app that provides a free finance education experience to a wide and diverse audience. Utilizing gamification and incorporating various design patterns will encourage users to continue to learn and use the app. Almost like a choose your own adventure game, users will be prompted with a variety of tasks and opportunities to actively participate instead of passively watching videos or feeling overwhelmed by quizzes and tests. Finance Frog is their playground, and the risk-free environment will translate to more confidence when making financial decisions in real life.</p>
