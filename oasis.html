            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Online Advising Student Information System (OASIS) is a website that provides a variety of tools and services to UC Davis students. Many use it to submit major change requests, view their transcripts, monitor their academic performance, and more. However, the numerous tools that the platform has available makes using it to its full extent difficult.</p>

            <h2>Objective</h2>

            <p>The initial question posed was “How might we improve students’ experience of using OASIS as an advising tool to help them finish their degree?”</p>
            
            <p>After conducting five one-on-one interviews, I was able to refine my insight and ask for elaboration about specific aspects of OASIS such as the Degree Worksheet and Advising tools. I further narrowed down this problem statement to</p>

            <p>“How might we make OASIS an intuitive and fun resource for students and advisors to ascertain academic information?”</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>

            <h3>Surveys</h3>

            <p>I surveyed 37 UC Davis students using Google Forms. The survey responses provided quantitative data about current OASIS usage, in addition to likes, wants, and pain points.</p>

            <p>One key insight that I learned through the survey responses is that 24.3% of students use OASIS at night, and 51.4% use OASIS at night and during the day. This contributed to my decision to implement a dark mode.</p>

            <p>Another key insight I learned is that 36 out of the 37 respondants use OASIS primarily on a laptop or desktop. This informed my decision to design a desktop application.</p>

            <img src="images/oasis-insight2.png" alt="survey results">

            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p>To further understand the current OASIS experience, I conducted five one-on-one interviews. Not only was I able to ask for elaboration about pain points, but I was able to dig deeper into specific features of Oasis such as the major worksheet feature and the advising resources list.</p>

            <p>Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative data, my findings demonstrated that people have the most difficulty navigating the major worksheet feature, and people appreciate the advising resources list the most.</p>

            <h2>Pain Points</h2>
            <p>I organized my research using affinity mapping. Each sticky note was designated with a like, want or pain point from the survey and interviews I conducted.</p>

            <p>By utilizing the framework of affinity mapping, I was able to identify four pain points that were experienced by multiple users.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Overload of information that is too small, difficult to read, and cluttered</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Trouble navigating the site because of nested tabs</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Degree worksheets are difficult to find and organize</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Making advising appointments is not a pleasant experience</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="ideation">
            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>With my pain points established, I moved onto ideation. While engaging in a rapid ideation sprint, I was conscientious of coming up with ideas that addressed the users' pain points.</p>

            <img src="images/ideation-sprint.png" alt="ideation">

            <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
            <p>While I would have liked to implement a lot of the features from the rapid ideation sprint, I decided to stick to a handful of them. Once I had chosen which ideas to move forward with, I sketched them in my low-fidelity wireframes.</p>

            <img src="images/oasis-sketches.png" alt="lo-fi wireframes">
        </section>

        <section class="mid-fi-prototyping">
            <h2>Mid-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
            <p>After considering the intuitiveness and hierarchy of my low-fidelity wireframes, I decided to implement two of them into my mid-fidelity prototype.</p>

            <p>The decision to combine the Home page with the Advising Record page significantly reduced confusion about where to find advising information (the former Home page had "My Advising" and "Advising Resources" and "Documents and Files" and "Appointment History" on the Advising Record page).</p>

            <p>Additionally, I moved forward with two columns on the home page instead of three to allow the user more ease while reading information.</p>

            <img src="images/my-advising.png" alt="mid-fi wireframes">

            <p>The Degree Worksheets page features a more visual approach to displaying new and recent worksheets. Similar to the Home page, the Degree Worksheets page features condensed blocks of information to allow the user to easily process information.</p>

            <img src="images/degree-worksheets.png" alt="mid-fi wireframes">

            <p>Users also requested a more customizable and personal experience while using OASIS. To appease to this want, I integrated a preferences pop-up that allows the user to choose from preset light and dark mode, in addition to WCAG approved color combinations with high contrast ratios and a color picker for the most ambitious users.</p>

            <img src="images/preferences.png" alt="preferences wireframe">

            <h2>User Testing</h2>

            <p>The mid-fidelity prototype was tested with five participants, all of whom are students at UC Davis and have prior experience using OASIS.</p>

            <h3>Positive Feedback</h3>

            <ul class="testing-ul">
                <li>Vertical menu looks cleaner and page names are more apparent</li>
                <li>Information is more condensed and easier to read</li>
                <li>Central search bar is helpful for first-time users of OASIS</li>
                <li>Virtual student ID is fun and practical</li>
                <li>Customization options provide user with more autonomy</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Areas to improve</h3>

        <section class="hi-fidelity">
            <h2>Design System</h2>
            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>All background and font color choices meet WCAG Level AAA contrast ratio requirements ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for the visually impaired.</p>

            <img class="wcag" src="images/wcag.jpg" alt="WCAG contrast checker">

            <h3>Colors</h3>
            <p>During my user testing, I was met with overwhelming approval of dark mode as many users reported using OASIS at night. I used the traditional UC Davis colors, blue and yellow, as accent colors in both dark and light mode.</p>
            <img class="colors" src="images/oasis-colors.jpg" alt="oasis colors">

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>As Poppins is a sans-serif font, it is generally easier to read on the web, and it is better for large blocks of text. I chose Poppins for the brand standard because it reflects the modernity of our society (many users complained that the current OASIS interface appears "outdated"), in addition to being lively and clean.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>By far the biggest challenge that I encountered with this case study was evaluating which features would provide the most holistic improvement in users’ experience with Oasis. I had a lot of ideas that I wanted to implement, but because of the quick turnaround, I had to decide which ones would be the most impactful and help the most users.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>One valuable lesson that this project taught me is the importance of iteration. In the beginning, I was so concerned with reaching a specific level of perfection that I was neglecting the succeeding steps of the human centered design process. I was hyper focused on my mid-fi prototype and I didn’t consider how the time might be better spent on user testing or the hi-fi prototype. Now, I know not to get too caught up in any part of the process, and to instead reiterate if needed.</p>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>I am really interested in further developing the Degree Worksheets page. Although time did not permit, I has planned on designing the Degree Worksheet page to have a version history that users could refer to instead of having multiple worksheets saved every time an edit is made. Additionally, I would have liked to make the instructions more clear and more visible since quite a few users reported having trouble figuring out how to fill out a degree worksheet.
